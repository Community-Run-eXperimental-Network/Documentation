Any inventive uses of CRXN.

=== Chris's IPv6 NETMAP ===

Chris has setup a netmapping of IPv6 addresses to the CRXN IPv4 `10.0.0.0/8` range. What this means is that
any IPv6 packets sent to the IPv6 addresses in the range he has setup will have their packets transformed into
IPv4 packets with a source IP of `10.5.0.1` and a destination determined by a mapping of `(IPv6 clear-net) -> (IPv4 crxn)`.

This means CRXN can actually be accessed over the clear-net as well!
